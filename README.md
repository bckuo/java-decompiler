# Intro
The purpose of this project is simply unzip a `jar` and decompile the `class` files to `java` files. The goal is to mimic the result of viewing libraries in Intellij.

The code requires `.env` file to pass the root of the library to decompile and path to java 17.
The code expect the `fernflower.jar` at the root of the folder.

The version of Python used is `3.12.10`. 
The version of Java is 17.

# Credits

The fernflower code is from [Intellij community Github](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/plugins/java-decompiler/engine).

Please refer the link for the manual of the `fernflower.jar`.
